# Tortue

Hello, coding adventurer! Welcome to **Tortue** (say "tor-too")—a fun turtle made in Rust, a super cool programming language. If you've played with Logo on [Turtle Academy](https://turtleacademy.com), you'll love this! Tortue is like your own digital pet turtle that can draw squares, circles, and all sorts of shapes on the screen.

## What's Tortue All About?

- **Drawing**: Tell Tortue to move forward, turn right, or lift its pen—watch it doodle!
- **Rust Power**: Rust is fast and safe, perfect for making games and apps.
- **Your Ideas**: Want a turtle that dances or draws stars? You can make it happen!

## Why Did We Make It?

We're building a new one from scratch—simple, fun, and crash-free! It's like Logo but with Rust's magic.

## What's Coming?

- Move Tortue with commands like `forward 100` or `right 90`.
- Draw shapes with pretty colours.
- Steer it with arrow keys, like a game!
- Maybe even type Logo words to boss it around.

## How to Play?

1. Open a terminal (that black box with words).
2. Type `cargo run` to wake Tortue up.
3. Watch it draw (soon—we're starting small!).

Stick around—this is just the beginning! Got ideas? Tell us—we're making Tortue together!

Happy coding!
